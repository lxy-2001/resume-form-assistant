# Specification Quality Checklist: 资料标准化与人工纠正

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before planning
**Created**: 2026-09-05
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User stories cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- F003 reuses F001's existing persistence and F002's short-lived import task; exact file and contract changes belong in `plan.md`.
- Remote model invocation remains outside the implementation boundary unless a later feature explicitly adds a provider and consent contract.
